  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements. REQ-1 is addressed in backend/main.mo with the new ProgramDaySlot type and updated programSchedule storage, plus a migration module. REQ-2 is addressed in ManagePrograms.tsx with a day selector including all five weekdays. REQ-3 is addressed in SchedulePage.tsx with grouped/labeled weekday display, and OnAirDisplay.tsx/UpcomingShows.tsx with weekday-aware matching. All acceptance criteria appear to be met.",

      "description": "Saturday and Sunday are included as selectable options in the ManagePrograms day selector (ALL_DAYS array) and are rendered with color accents in SchedulePage, going beyond the weekday-only (Mon–Fri) scope specified in REQ-2 and REQ-3.",
      "reason": "The build request explicitly lists 'Adding weekend (Saturday/Sunday) program slots' as a non-goal, yet the diff adds Saturday and Sunday as selectable days in ManagePrograms (ALL_DAYS) and renders them in SchedulePage with dedicated styling.",

      "description": "The migration module (backend/migration.mo) duplicates each existing program into all five weekdays when migrating, which was not requested.",
      "reason": "No migration behavior was specified in the build request. Automatically spreading existing programs across Monday through Friday introduces unintended data duplication not covered by any requirement or acceptance criterion.",
